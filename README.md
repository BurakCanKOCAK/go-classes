# Go classes

This repo contains resources for Golang classes as a part of Technologies of Software Development course.

## Presentation

The presentation was created using [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md). You can either:

-   Read it's markdown source from the repo
-   Run it locally using `reveal-md slides.md` (after installing reveal-md via `npm install -g reveal-md`; if you are uneasy about installing an npm package globally, there is an option to run it in a Docker container)
-   View it deployed on Netlify: [here](https://go-classes.netlify.com)

## Assignments

As usual, the assignments are split into 3 levels:

-   satisfactory
-   sufficient
-   excellent
