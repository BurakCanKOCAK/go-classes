# Pieces of cake :white_circle:

1. Write a function `palindrome` that determines if a given string is a palindrome.
2. TODO
3. TODO
4. Write a function `fib` that takes a slice _k_ of _n_ ints (_k<sub>0</sub>..k<sub>n-1</sub>_) as an argument and returns the sum of all _k<sub>i</sub>-th_ elements of the Fibonacci Sequence. If one number appears more than once in the input slice, it's corresponding Fibonacci Sequence element should be added once for each occurrence.

```go
fib([]int{1, 2, 3}) // 4; explenation: 1 => 1, 2 => 1, 3 => 2, their sum = 4
fib([]int{1, 2, 8}) // 24; explenation: 1 => 1, 2 => 1, 8 => 21, their sum = 24
```
